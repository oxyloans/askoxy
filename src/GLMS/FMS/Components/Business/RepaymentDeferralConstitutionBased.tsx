            Deferral is an option in which a customer defers their future EMI
            for a certain period of time, and the bank charges some fees to do
            the same. Such scenarios happen mostly around festivals. The
            deferral process can be for individual finances, batch-wise, or
            globally for the entire portfolio.

            The Deferral screen has an option to select the constitution of the
            customer. The system allows users to set the deferral policy based
            on rules defined with respect to the customer segment. If the
            customer falls into the SME category, different rules can be defined
            applicable only to SME customers. The Deferral screen includes a
            List of Values (LoV) for selecting the constitution, and the
            finances displayed are based on the customer's constitution. If the
            constitution is selected as SME, the list of all finances under that
            constitution is displayed, and the user can select a single finance
            or all finances. In the Deferral Query screen, the user enters the
            deferral effective date and the number of deferrals. All selected
            finances will be deferred.
