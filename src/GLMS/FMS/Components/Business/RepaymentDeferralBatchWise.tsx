            Deferral is an option in which a customer defers their future EMI
            for a certain period of time, and the bank charges some fees to do
            the same. Such scenarios happen mostly around festivals. The
            deferral process can be for individual finances, batch-wise, or
            globally for the entire portfolio.

            Batch Wise Deferral is a process wherein deferral of Installment is
            done for the entire portfolio. Batch Wise deferral is usually
            provided to the customer during festive seasons and is applied to
            the entire portfolio. No deferral rule matrix is looked upon in case
            of global deferrals. Deferment fees will be charged in case of
            global deferrals. For global deferrals, a file will be provided that
            will have the list of finances for which deferral is to be done.
            This file will get uploaded into the system and the deferral process
            will be executed.
