          <p className="mb-2">
            Once the finance application is approved by the underwriter, the
            customer is required to provide certain documents at the PDOC stage
            and specify the mode of repayment for the finance. The customer can
            choose cash, PDC, ATM, or remittance as the mode of repayment. When
            the mode of repayment is PDC, the customer provides blank PDCs for
            the entire tenure. Once the blank PDCs are received from the
            customer, the system shall print the PDCs for the finance
            application with the Payee Name, due date as the cheque date, and
            the installment amount on all the cheques as per the repayment
            schedule.
